# For production, we configure the host to read the PORT
# from the system environment. Therefore, you will need
# to set PORT=80 before running your server.
#
# You should also configure the url host to something
# meaningful, we use this information when generating URLs.
#
# Finally, we also include the path to a manifest
# containing the digested version of static files. This
# manifest is generated by the mix phoenix.digest task
# which you typically run after static files are built.

# ## Using releases
#
# If you are doing OTP releases, you need to instruct Phoenix
# to start the server for all endpoints:
#
#     config :phoenix, :serve_endpoints, true
#
# Alternatively, you can configure exactly which server to
# start per endpoint:
#
#     config :routing_securely_with_phoenix_framework, RoutingSecurelyWithPhoenixFramework.Endpoint, server: true
#
